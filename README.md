# Tachyons Extension For Quarto

This extension adds the [TACHYONS - Css Toolkit](http://tachyons.io/) to a quarto HTML document or quarto revealjs presentation. 

> Functional CSS for humans.
> Quickly build and design new UI without writing CSS.

It allows changing the design of HTML elements by adding classes to them.

## Installing


If you want to start with a template do:
```bash
quarto use template nareal/tachyons
```


You just want to install the extension use:

```bash
quarto add nareal/tachyons
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.
If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.


To update the extension use:

```bash
quarto update extension nareal/tachyons
```

and to remove it:

```bash
quarto remove extension nareal/tachyons
```

## Using

To use the extension simply add it as a filter to the YAML header of the quarto document, for example:

```
---
title: "Tachyons Example"
filters:
  - tachyons
---
```

You can now use the library by adding its classes to the HTML elements.
